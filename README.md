# Test Driven Development with xUnit in C#

## Overview

This repository contains C# programs developed using xUnit for Test Driven Development (TDD). The goal of this project is to demonstrate best practices in TDD, ensuring that all functionalities are thoroughly tested and validated.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Showcase the use of xUnit for unit testing in C#.
- Implement TDD principles in real-world scenarios.
- Provide examples of writing and maintaining test cases.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **src/**: Contains all the source code for the application.
- **tests/**: Contains all the unit test cases using xUnit.
- **docs/**: Documentation related to the project, including design decisions and TDD guidelines.
